## Frogger
This was my final project for the Unity Live Project where I was tasked with remaking a classic arcade game within a 2 week sprint. 

## Run!!
As a challenge, I was given 2 days to create an original game, complete with art and a full gameplay loop. I created Run!!, a game of tag between a cute duck and a jealous penguin. Players take control of the duck (using mouse clicks for movement) and have to keep away from the penguin for as long as possible. The game is complete with a title and ending screen. The game starts with a 3 second countdown (player and enemey movement is frozen) and then the game starts and the penguin begins to hunt the player. There is a timer that starts at the end of the countdown and stops as soon as you are captured. Your final time is displayed on the end screen. I also, added a few UI sounds, countdown sounds, music, and ambience.

## Mini Solar System
This is an animated model of the Sun, Earth, and Moons orbit using assets I found on the Unity assets store. I used a point light and area light to recreate the lighting of the Sun and how it shines on the Earth and Moon as they orbit. The objects rotate as they orbit around each other to demonstrate how our solar system operates.

## Unity Fundamentals
This project was a part of the Unity 2018 Fundamentals course on Pluralsight. It started off with prototyping the general game ideas based on a game design document. From there, I created a basic level using ProBuilder. Finally I imported the final art assets, configured prefabs, added various lighting, created VFX, character animations, UI, and implemented audio.

## Ball Motion
This was a rapid unity assignment to create a simple maze game from scratch using Unitys built-in 3D game objects. The player takes control of a ball and navigates through a 3D maze course to find the exit.
